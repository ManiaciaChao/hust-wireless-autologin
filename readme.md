# hust-wireless-autologin

A server is required to make this work.

## Description

If you are just a huster who are tired of the repeating login of HUST-WIRELESS, go to [Cra1gTucker/hust-login](https://github.com/Cra1gTucker/hust-login) or [colinaaa/hustwireless](https://github.com/colinaaa/hustwireless).

If you are too poor to afford the Campus Network or don't wanna to pay, this repository can be helpful. **However, a server is needed to make this work.**

As is known to all, UDP protocol via port 53 is available even when
uncertified in most Campus Network based on Ruijie Certification.
